# Asset Modules

This is a set of modules that provide the ability for the Asset Publisher to
display only Web Content articles that have been read/viewed by non-Guest users.

- [asset-ext-api](asset-ext-api) This module is an API generated by
ServiceBuilder for the AssetExt entity.

- [asset-ext-service](asset-ext-service) This module is an IMPL generated by
ServiceBuilder for the AssetExt entity. See [service.xml](asset-ext-service/service.xml)

- [asset-ext-web](asset-ext-web) This module contains an administrative portlet
that provides the ability to reset/mark all Web Content assets as being
**unread** by all users.

- [asset-publisher-unread-content-filter](asset-publisher-unread-content-filter) When
deployed, this module inserts itself into the Asset Publisher controller/
service calls so that it will return dynamic search results that are **unread**
by the user. Note that the following config files must be deployed to
$LIFERAY_HOME/osgi/configs for it to work:

    - [AssetPublisherWebConfiguration.config](../../configs/common/osgi/configs/com.liferay.asset.publisher.web.internal.configuration.AssetPublisherWebConfiguration.config)
    - [UnreadAssetsConfig.config](../../configs/common/osgi/configs/com.liferay.asset.publisher.unread.content.filter.internal.UnreadAssetsConfig.config)

- [asset-viewed-listener](asset-viewed-listener) When deployed, this module
inserts itself into the Asset Publisher view tier for when full_content.jsp is
included in the response. If so, then the corresponding Web Content article is
marked as having been **read** by the user.
